# What next? Reproducibility in research

## First thing: *True* reproducibility is basically impossible {.center}

## Better: "reproducibility at dissemination / archiving" or "inspectability" [@Gil2016] {.center}

::: notes
Ask if learners can put their laptop lids down, so you have their full
attention.

True reproducibility means being able to re-create the results on *any*
computer at any point in the near future. But with different software
versions, unmaintained or difficult to install dependencies, constant
updates, differences between operating systems, and data sharing (which
is a bit of a joke in health research). Reproducibility quickly becomes
impossible. Hence why focusing on being reproducible at the time of
publication or at the very least focus on ensuring your data analysis is
"inspectable", meaning that someone can come and read your code and
understand the logic of what you are doing, even if they can't directly
reproduce the results.

## Few share code within health sciences [@Considine2017a, @Rauh2019, @Evans2019, @Rauh2019a, @Hughes2019, @Peng2006a, @Seibold2021] {.center}

::: notes
-   Estimating the reproducibility of scientific studies is currently
    very difficult because of:
    -   Nearly non-existent publishing of code/data
    -   General lack of awareness of and training in it
:::

## How can we check reproducibility if no code is given? {.center}

Possible role models as research groups: [Jeff
Leek](http://jtleek.com/codedata.html) and [Ben
Marwick](https://faculty.washington.edu/bmarwick/#publications). Or
[Steno Aarhus' GitHub account](https://github.com/steno-aarhus/)!

::: notes
But that doesn't even matter, because we can't have reproducibility if
no one shares their code!

And this is no joke. Getting data on this is difficult, but the research
that has been done shows that almost no one is sharing their code. The
estimates range between fields in health science from zero to maybe five
percent of published studies. The only area that is doing pretty well is
bioinformatics, at about 60% of published studies.

We as researchers try to find our niche, make our own space in the
research world. Sometimes its a real struggle to find that niche.. but
guys! No one is doing this, no one is sharing their code! You start
doing the simplest thing of sharing your code and you will be one of
very very few people who do. And this isn't a niche, this is a gaping
hole in our modern scientific process. A huge hole.

# Multiple benefits, from personal to philosophical

## It's a core principle of the scientific method: Verification {.center}

## Learning more from others: For PhD students to senior researchers {.center}

## More exposure and visibility: More output to show and be seen {.center}

## So few are doing open science, this is a great niche! {.center}

## Easier and quicker collaboration (aside from the learning part) {.center}

## More productive as you can more easily work on your own project {.center}

## Finding better opportunities outside of academia {.center}

::: notes
And the last one is that one reason you don't see a lot of researchers
sharing their code or being more reproducible is.. they end up getting
picked up by industry and paid really well or decide to leave academia
because of the barriers.

Just as an example, I found a Norwegian group who had a really
inefficient workflow and decided to re-build their workflow to make use
of programming, to be reproducible, to have a pipeline. I looked up the
lead author as well as several other of the co-authors and guess what...
many of them now work in really great companies as data scientists or
software engineers, probably making a lot of money and having
potentially a less stressful life.

# Strong institutional barriers, such as ... {.center}

::: notes
You will encounter a lot of resistance, a lot of barriers and hardship.
:::

## Lack of adequate awareness, support, infrastructure, training {.center}

::: notes
At the institutional level, there is no real awareness of this, no
support or infrastructure. You're basically doing this on your own.
Which probably isn't that uncommon anyway.

Your organization is moving in the right direction to resolve this
issue, but actions tell more than words.
:::

## Research culture values publications over all else {.center}

What would you spend your time on if we didn't have this
publication-obsession?

::: notes
Research culture and incentives pretty much only care about publishing
journal articles. Creating software tools or datasets to be shared, meh.
Making teaching materials to help other researchers, meh. Communicating
your science to the public and doing outreach, meh. Doing actual science
that might take years and not lead to any "hard papers", meh.

Imagine if the number of publications and where you published didn't
matter for getting funding or getting a research job. What would you
spend your time on? What would you do differently compared to now?
:::

## Legal and privacy concerns about sharing data, intellectual property protection, patents {.center}

::: notes
Legal and privacy concerns are big topics that institutions in
particular focus on a lot, about ownership and so on, since research can
lead to commercialization and the potential for profit. For individual
researchers, we often worry about these concerns too much and sometimes
stops us from doing work because we're afraid we're doing something
wrong
:::

# Strong personal barriers like ... {.center}

## Fear of ... {.center}

-   Fear of being scooped or ideas being stolen
-   Errors and public humiliation

::: notes
And there aren't just institutional barriers. We as researchers have
fears of being scooped, of embarrassment and humiliation for your
methods being *gasp* wrong. Which is actually just part of science.
:::

## Overwhelmed with everything that we *should* do better {.center}

Strongly rewarded to get things done, not get things right.

::: notes
It is also really overwhelming, having so many things to think about to
make sure you're doing solid science. No researcher in the past had to
consider and think and know as much as we have to know and to do.
Another reason why we need more team science, to distribute the tasks
and skills.
:::

## Need to constantly stay updated {.center}

::: notes
You also have to constantly stay updated, and that can be tiring.
:::

# So... what you can do right now to be more open and reproducible?

## Follow some core principles {.center}

-   Use open source tools wherever possible

-   Use plain text as often as possible

-   Upload and share publicly early and often (e.g. to GitHub or
    [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org))

-   Upload and share publicly as many things as possible

## Use social actions to be more open {.center}

-   Do code/paper reviews through *through GitHub*

-   Require writing *everything* in Markdown

-   Agree on a standard folder and file structure for projects

## Teach others! {.center}

It's also a great way to learn :wink: :wink:

::: notes
Lastly.. you can teach. Teach others. Use these teaching materials. Or
get involved with this workshop next year. Or now. Actually, several
participants from the beginner workshop are or will soon be helping to
improve the material for next year. There are also so many other things
you can get involved in, aside from this workshop. Let me know if you're
interested!
