Go over the text again, to reinforce the workflows shown in the diagrams
and, briefly, the reasons why we do certain things. Especially reinforce
why we have the separation between `learning.qmd` and `functions.R`.

**Time: \~15 minutes.**

This section provides an bigger picture view of what we will be doing,
why we want to do it, how we will be going about doing it, and what it
will look like in the end. So the overall practical aim of this workshop
is:

*To apply a reproducible and programmatic approach to efficiently
downloading a dataset that has multiple data files, then processing and
cleaning them all, and saving them as a single data file to use for
later analysis.*

In our case, during the workshop we want to process the DIME data so
that we have a single dataset to work with for later (hypothetical)
analyses. Which can be visually summarised as:

```{mermaid}
%%| label: "fig-big-picture-aim"
%%| fig-cap: "Big picture aim of the workshop."
%%| fig-alt: "A diagram representing the overall flow from start to end of the workshop, with nodes for files pointing into code and outputting a final dataframe."
flowchart LR
  file_a[/"data-raw/cgm/101.csv"/]
  file_etc[/"data-raw/cgm/*.csv"/]
  file_z[/"data-raw/cgm/127.csv"/]
  file_a & file_etc & file_z --> code(R code to<br>process data)
  code --> final_data[(Dataframe<br>for analysis)]
```

We also want to make sure that whatever processing we do to the data is
reproducible, so we'll be writing the code in a way that enables and
enforces reproducibility of the code.

So how specifically will we do this? At the highest level, everything
revolves around files and folders. Below is what the project currently
looks like and what it will look like at the end of the workshop.
Notice, the only differences here are the addition of a new file in the
`data/` folder and a new HTML file in the `docs/` folder. The new file
in the `data/` folder is the final dataset we will be creating, and the
new HTML file in the `docs/` folder is the rendered Quarto document that
we will be creating.

:::

This structure, particularly the use of the `.Rproj` file and the
`DESCRIPTION` file (that we will cover in this workshop) are part of a
"project-based workflow" that is commonly used. We use this type of
workflow because we want to follow some standard conventions in R, like
having a `DESCRIPTION` metadata file, keeping raw data in the
`data-raw/` folder, and keeping (most) R scripts in the `R/`. We also
want to keep things structured to make it easier for others and
ourselves to reproduce the work. Below are sections for the different
workflows we will be using in the workshop.

## :technologist: Exercise: What types of workflows do you use?

**Time: \~6 minutes.**

The process of learning is about taking the content you just learned and
trying to integrate it into your own context and situation, as well as
talking about it to enforce it into your brain. So:

-   Take 1 minutes to think about the workflows you use in your own work.
    Since we'll be covering different workflows in this workshop, we would
    like you to try to think of your own and how it will compare to the ones
    taught. Try to think very explicitly what you do and how you do it.
-   Then, with your neighbour, take 5 minutes where each of you share
    what you've thought about and discuss it. How do both of your ways
    of working compare to each other and to what was described above?
