## The Big Picture

::: callout-note
## Reading task: \~10 minutes

This section provides an bigger picture view of what we will be doing,
why we want to do it, how we will be going about doing it, and what it
will look like in the end.

Big picture aim:

> To apply a reproducible and programmatic approach to efficiently
> downloading multiple data files, processing and cleaning them, and
> saving them as a single data file.

In our case during the course, we ultimately want to process the MMASH
data so that we have a single dataset to work with for later
(hypothetical) analyses.

We also want to make sure that whatever processing we do to the data is
reproducible. So everything we'll do throughout the course is done in
order to achieve our aim of making a single dataset and to make things
reproducible.

Both the folder and file structures below as well as the Figure
@fig-overview show exactly what we will be doing and how it will look
like at the file level (not at the R code level). Hopefully with this
overview, you can better understand where we are and where we want to
get to.

Right now, everyone's initial project structure should look like:

```         
LearnR3
├── data/
│   └── README.md
├── data-raw/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── mmash-data.zip
│   ├── mmash/
│   │  ├── user_1
│   │  ├── ...
│   │  └── user_22
│   └── mmash.R
├── doc/
│   ├── README.md
│   └── learning.qmd
├── R/
│   ├── functions.R
│   └── README.md
├── .gitignore
├── DESCRIPTION
├── LearnR3.Rproj
├── README.md
└── TODO.md
```

At the end of this workshop, it should look something like:

```         
LearnR3
├── data/
│   ├── README.md
│   └── mmash.rda
├── data-raw/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── mmash-data.zip
│   ├── mmash/
│   │  ├── user_1
│   │  ├── ...
│   │  └── user_22
│   └── mmash.R
├── doc/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── learning.html
│   └── learning.qmd
├── R/
│   ├── README.md
│   └── functions.R
├── .gitignore
├── DESCRIPTION
├── LearnR3.Rproj
└── README.md
```

Why do we structure it this way? Because we want to follow some standard
conventions in R, like having a `DESCRIPTION` metadata file, keeping raw
data in the `data-raw/` folder, and keeping (most) R scripts in the
`R/`. We also want to keep things structured to make it easier for
others and ourselves to reproduce the work.

Our workflow will generally look like Figure @fig-overview, with each
block representing one or two sessions. We've already done a bit of the
first block, *"Download raw data"*.

![Overview of the workflow we will be using and
covering.](/images/overview.svg){#fig-overview}

Our workflow and process will be something like:

-   Make an R script (`data-raw/mmash.R`) to download the dataset
    (`data-raw/mmash/`), which you already did in the pre-course tasks.
    -   We do this to keep the code for downloading and processing the
        data together with the raw data.
-   Use Quarto / R Markdown (`doc/learning.qmd`) to write and test out
    code, convert it into a function, test it, and then move it into
    `R/functions.R`. Later we will also move code into the
    `data-raw/mmash.R`. We use this workflow because:
    -   It's easier to quickly test code out and make sure it works
        before moving the code over into a more formal location and
        structure. Think of using the Quarto / R Markdown file as a
        sandbox to test out and play with code, without fear of messing
        things up.
    -   We also test code out in the Quarto / R Markdown because it's
        easier from a teaching perspective to interweave text and
        comments with code as we do the code-alongs and because it
        forces you to practice working within Quarto / R Markdown
        documents, which are key components to a reproducible workflow
        in R.
    -   Rendering a Quarto / R Markdown file runs all the code from
        beginning to end in a new environment (so completely clean),
        meaning we can test the reproducibility of our code. Because of
        this feature, it allows us to detect errors and issues with the
        code, making Quarto / R Markdown an excellent prototyping tool.
    -   We keep the functions in a separate file because we will
        frequently `source()` from it as we prototype and test out code
        in the Quarto / R Markdown file. It also creates a clear
        separation between "finalized" code and prototyping code.
-   Use a combination of restarting R ({{< var keybind.restart-r >}})
    and using `source()` with {{< var keybind.source >}} while in
    `R/functions.R` to run the functions inside of `R/functions.R`.
    -   We restart R because it is the only sure way there is to
        clearing up the R workspace and starting for a "clean plate".
        And for reproducibility, we should always aim to working from a
        clean plate.
-   Replace the old code in the Quarto / R Markdown document
    (`doc/learning.qmd`) with the new function.
-   Finish building functions that prepare the dataset, use them in the
    cleaning script (`data-raw/mmash.R`), run the script and save the
    data as an `.rda` file (`data/mmash.rda`).
    -   Like with the `R/functions.R` script, we move the finalized data
        processing code over from the Quarto / R Markdown into the
        `data-raw/mmash.R` script to have a clear separation of
        completed code and prototyping code.
    -   Why is the `data-raw/mmash.R` script not a Quarto / R Markdown
        file instead? Because our *aim* for the R script is to produce a
        specific dataset output, while the *aim* of a Quarto / R
        Markdown file is to create an output *document* (like HTML) and
        to test reproducibility. We use specific tools or file formats
        for specific purposes base on their design.
-   Remove the old code from the Quarto / R Markdown document
    (`doc/learning.qmd`).
    -   Once we've finished prototyping code and moved it over into a
        more "final" location, we remove left over code because it isn't
        necessary and we don't want our files to be littered with left
        over code. Again, like with restarting R often, we want to work
        from a clean plate.
-   Whenever we complete a task, we *add and commit* those file changes
    and save them into the Git history.
    -   We use Git because it is the best way of keeping track of what
        was done to your files, when, and why. It keeps your work
        transparent and makes it easier to share your code by uploading
        to GitHub. Using version control should be a standard practice
        to doing better science since it fits with the philosophy of
        doing science.
    -   **Note**: While we covered GitHub in the introductory course, we
        can't assume everyone will have taken that course. Because of
        that, we won't be using GitHub in this course.

Go over the text again, to reinforce the workflow, and the reasons why
we do certain things. Especially reinforce why we have the separation
between `mmash.R`, `learning.qmd`, and `functions.R`.

## Exercise: Discuss the types of workflows you use

> Time: 15 minutes.

-   Take 2 min to think about your workflow you use in your work. How do
    you *exactly* do the things you do (like what apps you use, how you
    collaborate, how you name your files and folders, where you save
    your work)?

-   Then for about 10 min, in your group/table share and discuss each
    others workflows. How do they compare to each other? What are things
    you'd like to try out in your own work? How do all your workflows
    compare with what has been described so far?

-   For the remaining time, as the whole group, we'll briefly share what
    you've all thought and discussed.

## Setting up our project

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" collapse="true"}
## Instructor note

Take this time to briefly explain the Git interface, what add and commit
mean, as well as where the history is located.
:::

Now that we've gone over the overview, let's get our project ready for
the next steps. But first, we need to do a few things. Since we did all
that work in the pre-course tasks downloading the data and unzipping it,
we need to save these changes to the Git history. Open the Git interface
with either the Git icon at the top near the menu bar, or with
{{< var keybind.git >}}. When the Git inferface opens up we'll click the
checkbox beside the `.gitignore` and `data-raw/mmash.R` files. Then we
write a commit message in the text box on the right, something like
`Code to download data zip file`. Click the "Commit" button and close
the Git interface.

Next, delete these two files we don't need by using the `{fs}` package.

In the **Console**, type out:

``` r
fs::file_delete("TODO.md")
fs::file_delete("doc/report.Rmd")
```

Then, open up the `README.md` and fix some of the TODO items. After
cleaning everything up, now we need to use Git to add and commit all the
current files into the history. Open up the Git interface in RStudio
with {{< var keybind.git >}} or through the Git button. Write a message
in the commit textbox saying `Added initial files`.

## Styling your files

Before moving to the next session, there's one more "setup" thing to do.
Since we write code for other humans (including ourselves in the
future), code should also *look* pretty, clean, and organized. To do
that, we'll follow a the tidyverse [style
guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) and use the package called
`{styler}`, which automatically fixes code to fit the style guide. With
`{styler}` you can style multiple files at once, one file at a time, or
based on code you select and highlight. Throughout the course, we will
re-style the file were are working on a lot. We'll do that by using the
Command Palette by typing {{< var keybind.palette >}}, followed by
typing "style file". The first one that pops up, which should say "Style
active file", will be the one to select and use. We'll get lots of
chances to use it as we go through the course. The thing to note is that
`{styler}` isn't always perfect, so you might need to sometimes manually
fix code
