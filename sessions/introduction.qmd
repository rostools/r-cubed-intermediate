This is the first time adding this, so mention that there is strong
evidence that when learners are aware of and involved in why learning
material is structured the way it is, they learn better. But we'd love
feedback on this.

Briefly walk through some of these things, as they form the basis for
the workshop.

## Other details

We collect feedback at the end of each session through the survey. It is
extremely helpful and has greatly improved the workshop material over
the years. So please, give us feedback!! We're all in this together,
learning and improving :grin:

Since this is also a space to socialise and network, we strongly
encourage you to sit besides someone you don't know during lunch. This
is also why we have you pick a piece of paper that has a table name on
it every day, so that you can sit with different people each day.

## :book: Reading task: Our roadmap

Go over the text again and use the diagrams to reinforce what our
roadmap is.
:::

**Time: \~15 minutes.**

This section provides a bigger picture view and roadmap of what we will
be doing, a bit on why we want to do it, and what it will look like in
the end. The overall practical aim or "destination" of this workshop is:

*To apply a reproducible and programmatic approach to efficiently
downloading a dataset that has multiple data files, then processing and
cleaning them all, and saving them as a single data file to use for
later analysis.*

In our case, during the workshop we want to process the DIME data so
that we have a single dataset to work with for later (hypothetical)
analyses. We have one CGM file and one sleep file for each participant,
as well as a single participant details file.

To get to a single dataset, let's work backwards:

1.  To get one final dataset, we need to join the CGM, sleep, and
    participant data together and in a way that makes sense.
2.  To join all the datasets together, they all need to be in a format
    that can be joinable. So they need to be cleaned.
3.  We need to clean the participant details data.
4.  We need to clean the CGM and sleep data.
5.  To clean the CGM data, we need to have one single CGM data frame to
    be able to clean on, but we currently have many. So we need to join
    ('bind') all the CGM data into one. This also applies to the sleep
    data.
6.  To get one CGM or sleep data frame, we need to first import it from
    each raw file.

Breaking these steps down visually, let's start with the final joining:

```{mermaid}
%%| label: "fig-roadmap-joined-data"
%%| fig-cap: "Roadmap for the workshop: Joining all the data into one."
%%| fig-alt: "A diagram representing the flow of nodes with arrows. Nodes on the left are the three data frames, with arrows into a join action node, and finally an arrow to the final data frame."
flowchart LR
  cgm[/"CGM<br>data frame"/]
  sleep[/"Sleep<br>data frame"/]
  participants[/"Participant details<br>data frame"/]
  join(Join together)
  final_data[/"One data frame<br>ready for analysis"/]

  cgm & sleep & participants --> join
  join --> final_data
```

Going backwards, to get to the single CGM data frame, we will need to
import all the files, 'bind' them together, and then clean them. The
same applies to the sleep. Visualised below for both CGM and sleep data:

```{mermaid}
%%| label: "fig-roadmap-cgm"
%%| fig-cap: "Roadmap for the workshop: Importing and cleaning all the CGM (or sleep) data files."
%%| fig-alt: "A diagram representing the flow of nodes with arrows. Nodes on the left are the individual files for CGM, that point into an import and binding action, that then move into cleaning, and finally to a single CGM data frame."
flowchart LR
  cgm_a[/"data-raw/dime/cgm/101.csv"/]
  cgm_etc[/"data-raw/dime/cgm/*.csv"/]
  cgm_z[/"data-raw/dime/cgm/127.csv"/]
  cgm[/"CGM<br>data frame"/]
  import(Import then<br>'bind' together)
  clean(Clean data)

  cgm_a & cgm_etc & cgm_z --> import
  import --> clean
  clean --> cgm
```

And for the participant details flow, it would be:

```{mermaid}
%%| label: "fig-roadmap-participant-details"
%%| fig-cap: "Roadmap for the workshop: Importing and cleaning the participant details data file."
%%| fig-alt: "A diagram representing the overall flow from start to end of the workshop, with nodes for files pointing into code and outputting a final dataframe."
flowchart TB
  participant_details[/"data-raw/dime/participant_details.csv"/]
  import(Import data)
  clean(Clean data)
  output[/"Participant details<br>data frame"/]

  participant_details --> import
  import --> clean
  clean --> output
```

We also want to make sure that whatever processing we do to the data is
reproducible, so we'll be writing the code in a way that enables and
enforces reproducibility of the code.

So, how will we do this, specifically? At the highest level, everything
revolves around files and folders. Below is what the project currently
looks like and what it will look like at the end of the workshop.
Notice, the only differences here are the addition of a new file in the
`data/` folder and a new HTML file in the `docs/` folder. The new file
in the `data/` folder is the final dataset we will be creating, and the
new HTML file in the `docs/` folder is the rendered Quarto document that
we will be creating.

:::

This structure, particularly the use of the `.Rproj` file and the
`DESCRIPTION` file (that we will cover in this workshop) are part of a
"project-based workflow" that is commonly used. We use this type of
workflow because we want to follow some standard conventions in R, like
having a `DESCRIPTION` metadata file, keeping raw data in the
`data-raw/` folder, and keeping (most) R scripts in the `R/`. We also
want to keep things structured to make it easier for others and
ourselves to reproduce the work.

::: callout-note
During the code-alongs, we will be working with the CGM and participant
details data. For the exercises, you will practice what you've learned
on the sleep data.

## :speech_balloon: Discussion activity: Warm-up questions!

**Time: \~8 minutes.**

A big part of learning is social. We are in a classroom and you are
listening to and interacting with the teacher (at least in some way).
But it also with your peers.

So, to help you feel more comfortable in this new physical and social
space, for the next 4 minutes, get up and chat with your neighbour about
the questions below:

1.  Who are you?
2.  Why are you here?
3.  What do you want to learn?

Make sure to share the time equally between each other. Then, after 4
minutes, chat with another neighbour at your table (or a table nearby)
for another 4 minutes. This time, talk about these questions:

1.  How do you perceive your skill in R?
2.  How much time do you spend *processing data* in R?
