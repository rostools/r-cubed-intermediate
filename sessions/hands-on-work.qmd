## Other datasets to try out

If you have completed the exercises above and still wanted to practice
the skills, here are some other datasets you can use (aside from your
own):

-   [MIMIC-IV demo data in the OMOP Common Data
    Model](https://physionet.org/content/mimic-iv-demo-omop/0.9/)
-   [RR interval time series from healthy
    subjects](https://physionet.org/content/rr-interval-healthy-subjects/1.0.0/)
-   [Data on the 2021 Olympics in
    Tokyo](https://www.kaggle.com/arjunprasadsarkhel/2021-olympics-in-tokyo)
-   Find your own dataset from
    [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/about/database/#open) or
    [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/search?page=1&size=20&q=diabetes&access_right=open&file_type=xlsx&file_type=csv&file_type=zip&type=dataset#).
-   Work on the game ["Murder
    Mystery"](https://r-murder-mystery.askeland.me/) (which
    Anders Askeland converted into a game using R).
