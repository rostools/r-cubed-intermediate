## What else can you do?

The other things you can start doing is find or start building a
community of people who also use R or are doing reproducibility or any
other computational work. Use them as support and help and also give
back too.

Start doing code reviews in your research group. Code review would be
where you look over each others code, check that it works, check that it
makes sense, that it's readable and understandable. The nice thing with
doing code reviews is that it dispels the mystery around code and about
criticizing it and trying to improve it. We review manuscripts, why not
code? Do note though, that this is way easier said than done!

You can teach! Teach others. Use these teaching materials. Or get
involved with this course next year. Or now! Several participants from
these courses are or will soon be helping to improve the material for
next year. There are also so many other things you can get involved in,
aside from this course. Let us know if you're interested!

We also have an informal, once-monthly, Coding Club you can join or
follow. Information about it is on the
[website](https://coding-club.rostools.org/). We do the sessions
virtually on the [r-cubed Discord
server](https://discord.gg/xHPyj7dxJx).
