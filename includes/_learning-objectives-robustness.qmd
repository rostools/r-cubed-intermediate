1.  Explain what R package dependency management is, why it is necessary
    when writing code and ensuring reproducibility.
2.  Use tools like `usethis::use_package()` to manage dependencies in an
    R project and use `::` to explicit use a specific function from a
    specific package in any functions you make.
3.  Identify and describe some basic principles and patterns for writing
    more robust, reusable, and general-purpose code.
