1.  Explain what functional programming, vectorization, and functionals
    are within R and identify when code is a functional or uses
    functional programming. Then apply this knowledge using the
    `{purrr}` package's `map()` function.

2.  Review the split-apply-combine technique and identify how these
    concepts make use of functional programming.

3.  Apply functional programming to summarize data using the
    split-apply-combine technique with `{dplyr}`'s `group_by()`,
    `summarise()`, and `across()` functions.
