1.  Describe some ways to join or "bind" data and identify which join is
    appropriate for a given situation. Then apply `{dplyr}`'s
    `full_join()` function to join two datasets together into one single
    dataset.

2.  Demonstrate how to use functionals to repeatedly join more than two
    datasets together.

3.  Apply the function `case_when()` in situations that require nested
    conditionals (if-else).
