1.  Review the split-apply-combine technique and identify how these
    concepts make use of functional programming.
2.  Apply functional programming to summarize data using the
    split-apply-combine technique with `{dplyr}`'s `group_by()`,
    `summarise()`, and `across()` functions.
3.  Identify and design ways to simplify the functions you make by
    creating general functions that contain other functions you've made,
    such as a general "cleaning" function that contains your custom
    functions that clean your specific data.
