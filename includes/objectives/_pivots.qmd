1.  Describe the concept of "pivoting" data to convert data in a "long"
    format to a "wide" format and vice versa.
2.  Identify situations where it is more appropriate that data is in the
    long or wide format.
3.  Apply the `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()` functions from the
    `{tidyr}` package to pivot data.
4.  Recognise and appreciate the impact that seeking out and using
    existing functions to solve problems has on how you get things done,
    instead of writing custom code to do the things you want. For
    example, looking through the functions found in packages like
    `{tidyr}`.
