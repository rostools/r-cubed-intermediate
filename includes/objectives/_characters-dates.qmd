1.  Use the powerful (but also very difficult) regular expressions to
    process and clean character data by making use of the `{stringr}`
    package.
2.  Handle dates and times in R using the `{lubridate}` package.
3.  Recognise when you trigger a "non-standard evaluation" error when
    you make functions using `{tidyverse}` functions and fix it by using
    `{{{ }}}`.
