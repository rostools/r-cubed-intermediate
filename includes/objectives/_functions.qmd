1.  Describe and identify the individual components of a function as
    well as the workflow to creating them, and then use this workflow to
    make one to import some data.
3.  Describe and apply a workflow of prototyping code into a working
    function in a Quarto document, moving the function into a script
    (called, e.g., `functions.R`) once prototyped and tested, and then
    using `source()` to load the functions into the R session. End this
    workflow with rendering the Quarto document with
    {{< var keybind.render >}} to ensure reproducibility.
