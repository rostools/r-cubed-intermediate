## Combining datasets

You'll notice a bunch of messages saying:

```text
New names:
* NA -> ...1
```

This is vroom letting you know that a column was renamed. vroom is telling you
this because you didn't explicitly indicate that you wanted to rename a column.
To fix that, you need to tell vroom exactly what you want. Let's look
at the help docs of vroom: `?vroom`. We see an argument called `.name_repair`
that handles naming of columns. Going into the link that is provided we go
to the `tibble::tibble()` help documentation. Scroll down to the `.name_repair`
argument documentation and we read that it treats problematic column names.
There are several options here, but the one I want to focus on is the comment about
"function: apply custom name repair". This is an important one because 
we eventually want to rename the columns to match the [style guide] by using `snake_case`.
And there's a package to do that called [snakecase][snakecase-pkg].

[snakecase-pkg]:

So to remove the messages and convert the variable names to snake case, we
would add `.name_repair = snakecase::to_snake_case` to all our functions so far.
For now, let's focus on the `import_user_info()` we created.

TODO: Get them to snakecase and name repair to all other functions.

But first! We need to add the snakecase as a dependency:

```r
usethis::use_package("snakecase")
```

```{r}
import_user_info <- function(file_path) {
    info_data <- vroom::vroom(
        file_path,
        col_select = -1,
        col_types = vroom::cols(
            Gender = vroom::col_character(),
            Weight = vroom::col_double(),
            Height = vroom::col_double(),
            Age = vroom::col_double()
        ),
        .name_repair = snakecase::to_snake_case
    )
    return(info_data)
}

import_saliva <- function(file_path) {
    saliva_data <- vroom::vroom(
        file_path,
        col_select = -1,
        col_types = vroom::cols(
            SAMPLES = vroom::col_character(),
            `Cortisol NORM` = vroom::col_double(),
            `Melatonin NORM` = vroom::col_double()
        ),
        .name_repair = snakecase::to_snake_case
    )
    return(saliva_data)
}

import_multiple_files <- function(file_paths, import_function) {
    data_files <- fs::dir_ls(here::here("data-raw/mmash/"),
                             regexp = file_paths,
                             recurse = TRUE)
    
    combined_data <- purrr::map_dfr(data_files, import_function,
                                    .id = "file_path_id")
    return(combined_data)
}

user_info_df <- import_multiple_files("user_info.csv", import_user_info)
saliva_df <- import_multiple_files("saliva.csv", import_saliva)
```

replace purrr with tidyverse

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

very briefly go over regexp (we used it before). This is way beyond the time 
available in this course to begin to cover it, but see TODO: Link resources and
a help to use for more information.

```{r}
user_info_df %>% 
    mutate(user_id = file_path_id %>% 
               stringr::str_extract("user_\\d\\d?")) %>% 
    select(-file_path_id)
```

Want to find which package a function comes from: use the help doc `?functionname`
or F1 when the cursor is over the function.

```{r}
extract_user_id <- function(imported_data) {
    imported_data %>% 
        dplyr::mutate(user_id = file_path_id %>% 
                   stringr::str_extract("user_\\d\\d?")) %>% 
        dplyr::select(-file_path_id)
}
```

Then load all ctrl-shift-l
```{r}
user_info_df %>% 
    extract_user_id()
```


To get it to work in all other functions, let's add this new function to the end of
`import_multiple_files()`

```{r}
import_multiple_files <- function(file_paths, import_function) {
    data_files <- fs::dir_ls(here::here("data-raw/mmash/"),
                             regexp = file_paths,
                             recurse = TRUE)
    
    combined_data <- purrr::map_dfr(data_files, import_function,
                                    .id = "file_path_id") %>% 
        extract_user_id()
    return(combined_data)
}

```

## Joins

There are many types of joins:

- Left
- Right
- Full

Image of joins

```{r}
full_join(user_info_df, saliva_df, by = "user_id")
```

We also eventually have other datasets to join together later on. Since
`full_join()` can only take two datasets at a time, do we then just keep 
using `full_join()` until all the other datasets are combined?
What if we get more data later on? Well, that's where more functional programming
comes in. Again, we have a simple goal: For a set of data frames, join them
all together. Here we use another functional programming concept called `reduce()`.
Like `map()`, which "maps" a function onto a set of items, `reduce()`
applies a function to each item of a vector or list, each time reducing the set
of items down until only one remains: the output. Let's use our simple function
`add_numbers()` from before and add up 1 to 5. Since `add_numbers()` only takes
two numbers, we have to give it two numbers at a time and repeat until we reach
5.

```{r add-numbers-function, echo=FALSE}
add_numbers <- function(num1, num2) {
    added <- num1 + num2
    return(added)
}
```

```{r}
# Add from 1 to 5
first <- add_numbers(1, 2)
second <- add_numbers(first, 3)
third <- add_numbers(second, 4)
add_numbers(third, 5)
```

Instead, we can use reduce to do the same thing:

```{r}
reduce(1:5, add_numbers)
```

This Figure \@ref(fig-reduce) visually shows what is happening within `reduce()`.

```{r image-reduce, fig.cap="A functional that iteratively uses a function on a set of items until only one output remains. Modified from the [RStudio purrr cheatsheet][purrr-cheatsheet].", out.width="75%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images/reduce.svg"))
```
So, for our `full_join()`, if we put the datasets together as a list, we can
`reduce()` them down into one dataset with `full_join()`.

```{r}
combined_data <- reduce(list(user_info_df, saliva_df), full_join)
combined_data
```

## Renaming all columns


Functionals don't just 

```{r}
combined_data %>% 
    rename_with(snakecase::to_snake_case)
```

## 

`r '-->'`
