Description: Reproducibility and open scientific practices are
    increasingly being requested or required of scientists and
    researchers, but training on these practices has not kept pace. This
    workshop intends to help bridge that gap and covers the fundamentals and
    workflow of data analysis in R. This repository contains the lesson,
    lecture, and assignment material for the workshop, including the website
    source files and other associated workshop administration files. For
