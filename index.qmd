Reproducibility and open scientific practices are increasingly demanded
of, and needed by, scientists and researchers in our modern research
environments. As our tools for generating data become more sophisticated
and powerful, we also need to use more sophisticated and powerful tools
for processing the data. Training on how to use these tools and how to
build modern data processing skills is lacking for researchers, even
though this work is extremely time-consuming and technical. As a
consequence of this lack of awareness for the need of these skills, how
*exactly* data is processed is poorly, if at all, described in
scientific studies. This hidden aspect of research could have major
impacts on the reproducibility of studies. This workshop is therefore
aimed to specifically to start addressing these types of problems.

The workshop is designed as a series of participatory live-coding
lessons, where the instructor and learners code together, and is
interspersed with hands-on exercises, discussion time, reading tasks,
and group project work, all while using a real-world (open) dataset.
This website contains *all* of the material for the workshop, including
for both the learner and the instructor. It is structured as a book,
with "chapters" as sessions, given in order of appearance. We make heavy
use of the website throughout the workshop where code-along sessions
follow the material on the website nearly exactly (with slight
modifications for time or more detailed explanations).

The workshop material was created using [Quarto](https://quarto.org) to
write the material and create the book format,
[GitHub](https://github.com/) to host the [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
repository of the material, and [GitHub
Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) with
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to build and host the website. The
original source material for this workshop is found on the
[`r-cubed-intermediate`](https://github.com/rostools/r-cubed-intermediate)
GitHub repository.

## Target audiences

This website and its content are targeted to three groups:

1.  For the **learners** to use during the workshop, both to follow
    along in case they get lost and also to use as a reference after the
    workshop ends. We assume the learner is someone who is currently or
    will soon actively be doing research (e.g. a PhD or postdoc), who is
    likely in biomedical research (but doesn't have to be), and who has
    limited knowledge on coding in R aside from at least having taken
    the [introductory workshop](https://r-cubed-intro.rostools.org). A
    more detailed description of who the learner is can be found in
    @sec-is-it-for-you.
2.  For the **instructors** to use as a guide for when they do the
    code-along sessions and presentations.
3.  For those who are **interested in teaching**, who may not have much
    experience or may not know where to start, to use this website as a
    guide to running and instructing their own workshops.
