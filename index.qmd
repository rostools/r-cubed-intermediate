Reproducibility and open scientific practices are increasingly demanded
of, and needed by, scientists and researchers in our modern research
environments. As we our tools for generating data become more
sophisticated and powerful, we also need to start using more
sophisticated and powerful tools for processing it. Training on how to
use these tools and build modern data analysis skills is lacking for
researchers, even though this work is highly time-consuming and
technical. As a consequence of this unawareness of the need for these
skills, how *exactly* data is processed is poorly, if at all, described
in scientific studies. This hidden aspect of research could have major
impacts on the reproducibility of studies. Therefore, this course was
created specifically to start addressing these types of problems.

The course is designed as a series of participatory live-coding lessons,
where the instructor and learner code together, and is interspersed with
hands-on exercises and group work using real-world datasets. This
website contains all of the material for the course, from reading
material to exercises to images. It is structured as a book, with
"chapters" as lessons, given in order of appearance. We make heavy use
of the website throughout the course where code-along sessions follow
the material on the website nearly exactly (with slight modifications
for time or more detailed explanations).

The course material was created using [Quarto](https://quarto.org) to
write the lessons and create the book format,
[GitHub](https://github.com/) to host the [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
repository of the material, and [GitHub
Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) with
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to build and host the website. The
original source material for this course is found on the
[`r-cubed-intermediate`](https://github.com/rostools/r-cubed-intermediate)
GitHub repository.

## Target audiences

This website and its content are targeted to three groups:

1.  For the **learners** to use during the course, both to follow along
    in case they get lost and also to use as a reference after the
    course ends. The learner is someone who is currently or will soon
    actively be doing research (e.g. a PhD or postdoc), who is likely in
    biomedical research, and who has no or little knowledge on coding
    in R. A more detailed description of who the learner is can be found
    in @sec-is-it-for-you.
2.  For the **instructors** to use as a guide for when they do the
    code-along sessions and lectures.
3.  For those who are **interested in teaching**, who may not have much
    experience or may not know where to start, to use this website as a
    guide to running and instructing their own workshops.
