# Networking and social activities

As you get more experienced in coding, the role of your network becomes
increasingly important both for continued learning, but also for
collaboration with others skilled in R. So, part of the workshop is also
about getting to know others!

So while we have formal social activities, try to seek out someone you
haven't met yet or who you haven't chatted with as much during the lunch
breaks.

## Day 1 {#social-day-1 .unnumbered}

After lunch, get in your group for the day and walk outside while
discussing these topics:

-   Share a positive or exciting experience you had with cleaning,
    processing, and preparing data for later analysis. It can be recent
    or in the past, but as long as it was a memorable and positive. What
    made it positive? Do you try to repeat that experience, or at least
    the feeling of it?
-   Share a challenging experience or barriers that you encounter while
    cleaning, processing, and preparing data. Why was it challenging or
    had barriers and how could you limit those for for next time?

## Day 2 {#social-day-2 .unnumbered}

After lunch, get in your group for the day and walk outside while
discussing this topic:

-   Think about the functions and functionals sessions. Discuss with
    your group some ideas on how you can implement making functions and
    using functionals in your work. What are some things you do
    repetitively (in code or general work) that you think would be great
    to have simplified or automated.
