Reproducibility and open scientific practices are increasingly demanded of,
and needed by, scientists and researchers in our modern research environments.
As we our tools for generating data become more sophisticated and powerful,
we also need to start using more sophisticated and powerful tools for processing it.
Training on how to use these tools and build modern data analysis skills is
lacking for researchers, even though this work is highly time-consuming
and technical. As a consequence of this unawareness of the need for these skills,
how *exactly* data is processed is poorly, if at all, described in scientific
studies. This hidden aspect of research could have major impacts on the
reproducibility of studies.
This course was created specifically to start addressing these types of problems.

The course is designed as a series of participatory live-coding lessons, where
the instructor and learner code together, and is interspersed with hands-on
exercises using some real-world datasets. This website contains all of the
material for the course, from reading material to exercises, to images. It is
structured as a book, with "chapters" as lessons, given in order of appearance.
We make heavy use of the website throughout the course
where code-along sessions follow the material on the website nearly exactly
(with slight modifications for time or more detailed explanations).

The course material was created using [rmarkdown] to write the lessons,
[bookdown] to create the book format, [GitLab] to host the [Git] 
repository of the material, and [GitLab CI] with [Netlify] to create the website.
The original source material for this course is found on the 
[`r-cubed-intermediate`] GitLab repository.
