<!-- TODO: Convert to be similar to the advanced course -->

Reproducibility and open scientific practices are increasingly demanded
of, and needed by, scientists and researchers in our modern research
environments. We increasingly produce larger and more complex amounts of
data that often need to be heavily cleaned, reorganized, and processed
before it can be analyzed. This data processing often consumes the
majority of the time spent coding and doing data analysis. And even
though this stage of data analysis is so time-consuming, there is little
to no training and support provided for it. This has led to minimal
attention, scrutiny, and rigour in describing, detailing, and reviewing
these procedures in studies, and contributes to the systemic lack of
code sharing among researchers. All together, this aspect of research is
often completely hidden and may likely to be the source of many
irreproducible results.

With this course, we aim to begin addressing this gap. Using a highly
practical approach that revolves around code-along sessions (instructor
and learner coding together), hands-on exercises, and group work,
participants of the course will learn:

1.  How to demonstrate what an open and reproducible data processing and
    analysis workflow looks like.
2.  How to apply some fundamental concepts, techniques, and skills
    needed for processing and managing data in a reproducible and
    well-documented way.
3.  Where to go to get help and to continue learning modern data science
    and analysis skills.

By the end of the course, participants will: have improved their
competency in processing and wrangling datasets; have improved their
proficiency in using the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) statistical
computing language; know how to write re-usable and well-documented
code; and know how to make modern and reproducible data analysis
projects.

## Is this course for you? {#sec-is-it-for-you}

This course is designed in a specific way and is ideal for you if:

-   You are a researcher, preferably working in the biomedical field
    (ranging from experimental to epidemiological). Specifically, this
    course targets those working on topics in diabetes and metabolism.
-   You currently or will soon do quantitative data analysis.
-   You either:
    -   have taken the [introduction to Reproducible Research in R
        course](https://r-cubed-intro.rostools.org/), since this course
        is a natural extension to that one;
    -   know a *little* to a *moderate* amount of R (or computing in
        general);
    -   know how to use R and have *some* familiarity with the
        [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) and
        [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/).

Considering that this is a natural extension of the [introductory
r-cubed course](https://r-cubed-intro.rostools.org/), this course
incorporates tools learned during that course, including basic Git usage
as well as use of RStudio R Projects. If you *do not* have familiarity
with these tools, you will need to go over the material from the
introduction course beforehand (more details about pre-course tasks will
be sent out a couple of weeks before the course).

While having these assumptions help to focus the content of the course,
if you have an interest in learning R but don't fit any of the above
assumptions, **you are still welcome to attend the course**! We welcome
everyone, that is until the course capacity is reached.

During the course, we **will**:

-   Learn how to use R, specifically those in the mid-beginner to
    early-intermediate level.
-   Focus only on the data processing and cleaning stage of a data
    analysis project.
-   Teach from a reproducible research and open scientific perspective
    (e.g. by making use of Git).
-   Be using practical, applied, and hands-on lessons and exercises.

And we **will not** learn:

-   The basics of using R and RStudio.
-   Statistics (these are already covered by most university
    curriculum).
