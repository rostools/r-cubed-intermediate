Day number 2 in the end was fast walked through. Maybe move som of the content from day 2 to day 3.
"You did so well! I have been absolutely floored by the levels of structure, pedagogy and engagement you and the course material have been marked by. Amazing that it's all for free, what a gift. Would recommend this course to anyone."
Thank you for a great course. It was clear to me that you had really thought about how to present this material and how participants would learn the most. The variation in activities was great. I wish I had participated in this course earlier and will definitely recommend it to others.
"The more exercises the better. If possible, include more."
Good learning environment and teachers were experts in problem solving.
"Great job everyone, I hope you also establish an advanced course soon!"
"very nice course, very helpful, super great atmosphere and lots of fun while learning a lot. Great teachers - really thank you! Shortcuts repeating has helped me a lot. Sometimes going through the output with everyone would have helped a bit to understand the coding a bit more."
Thanks for putting words on the need to change science :-)
It would be beneficial if we could practice creating figures.
Afternoon lessons tended to go a bit fast where everybody were really tired. Maybe we could  start a bit earlier (at 8 am) and finish earlier (at 3 pm) or also use the last afternoon for lessons.
"Awesome course. I would love if there was a ""build-on"" course, more advanced, in the future. Thank you for good teaching and well written material."
Thanks for this amazing course!
"Thank you for a wonderful course.  I really think going over the code parts in groups would be a good use of tiem and by repeatition it helps to consolidate knowledge . and improve understandng that  how the code was built, like now we add function, now we add argument etc."
It would be nice to give some extra excercises when the instructors are helping others
"I would have loved to have a short introductory session in the beginning, to get to know a little about the other participants, e.g. their names and their research focus.All in all, I fully enjoyed this course, I learnt a lot from it and will definitely implement in my daily data analysis. The atmosphere was very positive and warm, I was not afraid of asking a question. Thank you so much for this fantastic course!! I would definitely recommend it."
"I overestimated the dificulty of the course or underestimated my abilities. I get the importance of making sure everyone is on the same page, and I do think the ""code-along"" was nice. However, the tempo felt slow and I had to pass a lot of time just waiting. Also, both reading a section and the having it explained felt a bit much, I would choose one or the other."
