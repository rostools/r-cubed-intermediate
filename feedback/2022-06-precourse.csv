Please describe the problems you've had.,Codes are not working in the console
Please describe the problems you've had.,"I already described it. But getting error message  at this command:unzip(here(data-raw/mmash-data.zip),       exdir = here(data-raw),      junkpaths = TRUE)Error message: I unzip(here(data-raw/mmash-data.zip), exdir = here(data-raw),  :  error 1 in extracting from zip file"
Please describe the problems you've had.,"I attempted to use git (taking into account the lessens of the beginners course). During the committing step, Git wanted to save all my desktop files (also personal ones) and did not confine to the R project. Not sure why, as I followed the guide very closely. Manually deselecting each private file crashed R during multiple tries."
Please describe the problems you've had.,"I encountered several problems. Initially I experienced problems with incompatible versions/updates of R, Rstudio and Rtools. I fixed that problem by using an older version of Rtools. Another problem I faced was related to a package I did not have installed. In that case Google helped me :)"
Please describe the problems you've had.,In the beginning some of the codes did not work - it was related to updating to the newest version of Rtools. Problem solved.

"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Too long to read!
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",video clarifying more will be better as in the beginners guide
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","Well, it is difficult to say. I generally find the wording and way of doing things in R incomprehensible and overly inconvenient. For example running all these steps just to download the dataset. I guess it is because we should learn how to do these steps manually by writing the code instead of using the dropdown menu."

This did not help. If I had not gotten help from Isabell, I would not have managed to figure out what was wrong. So a better description of what to do, if this does not work would help (you link to a webpage if this happens, but this was not helpful., for me at least). The rest of the introduction hereafter was super, super good and easy to follow! :)# A pop-up to type in your name (first and last), # as well as your emailr3::setup_git_config()"
