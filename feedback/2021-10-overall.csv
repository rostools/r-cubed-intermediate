nope
Thank you so much. I really enjoyed the course.
nice and relaxed learning environment :) good with different instructors and that Luke started and ended the teaching sessions :)
"Being the worst at r at this course :) The instructors were really good, and I feel that they did not only provide me with the result, but they also made me understand how things work."
Please keep continuing the great job - hope it developes even further (more courses or materials) Thanks!
"Maybe more information on have the packages and functions work, and where to get information. I can be a bit difficult to aplly the to other datasets with another structure.  Great with getting info on a data analysis workflow."
"I do have a few things to mention, well that is not related to coding. It is more about well being. I would highly recommend to add the work out breaks in between may before lunch,  (https://cuckooworkout.com/) or suitable YouTube  videos where all of us stand and do some stretching exercise. Another great idea of randomly assigning people to new table every day. The siting arrangement and seat can also be improved (that may be not possible). I am highly looking for an advance course, to increase mine and other R coding skills and competency. I am really interested to teach, may be the beginner course or even this one (sufyan.suleman@sund.ku.dk)."
"Looking at others code. Learning how to read the files/documentation associated with a specific package. Ask, before course, if there is specific problems people would like to tackle."
