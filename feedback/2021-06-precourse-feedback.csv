"In your opinion, what could be improved?",-
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",-
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","Be sure that everybody long time before the course is advised to get new versions of R and R-studio. In Region H it takes weeks or months to get permissions. I had to download it to my private computer. I was put on the course from the waiting list, so I did not have a lot of time to prepare with new versions."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Can't think of anything at the moment
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","Difficult to assess how much of the tasks had been done, because of build-in links to rather long texts. Including all material in the same page/including a table of contents with estimated time for reading of each section, may have helped."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Having a go/no-go example of the functions you have to call to see if the project is set up correctly. (fx. maybe an example of what the expected output is when running r3::check_setup()). I had to update certain packages before getting the a-OK-checklist.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","How to pull and push to github, I cannot push those buttons so I need to figure it out myself. It is just mentioned in the intro precourse material, but there is no guide"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",I think it is already well organized
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I think it's quite clear, I don't have any problems following the instructions."

"In your opinion, what could be improved?",It is just perfect for and pre-task assignment.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Maybe little bit more detailed explanation how to install Git and launch r3 in the beginning.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Maybe more pictures of each step.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","Maybe some overall introduction/insight to why this is important/what is actually done throughout the steps. This may be more clear if I had attended the previous course, but I completed the tasks as described but am I bit perplexed of what I actually did."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",More sub-headings on the side bar would make it more easy to navigate
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","NA"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",No idea
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","Nothing.  Make these R course mandatory for SUND PhD students, please :)"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","On the top of my head, nothing."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","Perhaps the context from the beginner course could be integrated so it was not needed to jump to that, but really it was fine the way it is"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","Quite a lot of thorough reading, which could be shortened in some cases"

"In your opinion, what worked well?",Clear instructions. Nothing to comment on :)
"In your opinion, what worked well?",Everything
"In your opinion, what worked well?","Everything! All steps are very well-explained. As an intermediate R user who learned mostly from trial-and-error, this is the guide I was lacking when I introduced myself to R. I especially like the section on what to do if something doesn't work/how not to panic + explanation of why using formalized version control is essential. Language is gentle and doesn't talk down to the inexperienced user."
