## :teacher: Instructor note

Before beginning, get them to recall what they remember of the previous
session, either with something like Mentimeter, verbally, or using hands
/ stickies / origami hats. Preferably something that will allow everyone
to participate, not just the ones who are more comfortable being vocal
to the whole group.

Depending on what they write, you may need to briefly go over the previous
session.

Throughout the many times we've taught this course and others, we

already been answered!

## Code used in section

This lists *some*, but not all, of the code used in the section. Some code is
incorporated into Markdown content, so is harder to automatically list here in
a code chunk. The code below also includes the code from the exercises.

<!-- The stringr subset removes code chunks that aren't shown or typed by the learner. -->
```{r code-appendix}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false
#| ref-label: !expr stringr::str_subset(knitr::all_labels(), "^(unnamed-chunk-.*|purl-only-.*|setup|fig-.*)", negate = TRUE)
