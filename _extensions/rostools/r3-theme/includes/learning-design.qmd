This workshop is designed using the science of learning. Learning is
when new content gets incorporated into long-term storage in the brain
and in a way that it can be later retrieved from storage to be used
again. Some of the best ways to enable learning is to do "active
learning" by engaging with the material, practicing retrieving what was
just taught, repeatedly being exposed to and retrieve the content,
linking the new information with what you already know, and explaining
it to someone else.

We use a variety of activities to target the different pathways of
learning. A big part of learning is being engaged in the *process* of
learning, not just learning the content itself. So to help you be
engaged in your own learning, we want to involve you in the reasons
*why* we do the things we do. These are the things we do in this
workshop that we've designed to enable optimal learning:

-   We have a clear learning goal with a strong narrative throughout the
    workshop that ties back to that goal. It's much easier to learn when
    you have a better idea of where you are going, where you are at, and
    what to expect along the way.

-   The main activities are "code-alongs", where the teacher types on
    the computer and explains what it means while you type along. The
    connection between using the hands and doing something tangible
    helps reinforce learning. It also helps the teachers to go slower
    since we have to both explain and type things out, which helps you
    learn better. The phrase "less is more" applies strongly to
    learning.

-   We include several hands-on exercises that reinforce what was just
    taught through retrieval practice and repetition. It gives you a
    chance to engage with the material and the space to try it out on
    your own, so you start to get a real sense of how to do it yourself.

-   We have discussion activities to encourage linking the new
    information with what you already know and do in your work and how
    you can apply it. Since humans are social beings, we also tend to
    learn better when there is some social aspect to it. Explaining
    something to someone else is one of the best ways to learn! The
    quote "while we teach, we learn" from the Roman philosopher Seneca
    is true here.

-   We have minimal to no slides or lectures, as they are forms of
    information sharing with the lowest rates of learning. Instead we
    include reading tasks, so you can re-read things you may not
    understand, go at your pace, and take notes, all of which support
    learning. To help reinforce what you just read, the teacher will
    briefly summarise and emphasise key points after you've read it,
    which is another form of repetition and targets another part of the
    brain (the auditory pathway).

-   We include several breaks throughout the workshop to help you
    recharge and refocus. The brain is only able to effectively focus on
    one thing at a time in 30-50 minute blocks of time. That's why we
    mix together code-alongs, exercises, discussions, and reading to
    give your brain something different to focus on. But having an
    explicit break, even 5 minutes, is enough for the brain to better
    process and store what was covered.

-   We put all the material online so that it is easy for you to go back
    to after the workshop, which builds the repetition and retrieval
    practice part of learning.

-   Our brains can get easily distracted, which is completely normal! So
    if you get distracted during the workshop, you can go to the
    material online to quickly get caught up with where we are. We also
    make sure to follow the material on the website closely, so that it
    is easier for you to follow along.

-   Being in a safe and supportive environment puts the brain into a
    more relaxed state that also happens to be optimal for learning.
    Hence why we try to explicitly create that space, for example with
    the use of our Code of Conduct.

-   Asking for help can be a hard thing to do, especially in settings
    where you are learning and might be confused or struggling with
    something being taught. You might feel vulnerable asking for help
    and showing that you don't know something. To help reduce these
    feelings and to create a safer space, we regularly get you to put up
    little origami hats (or stickies) to assess how everyone is doing.
    If you need help or are struggling with something, you put up the
    "help" hat (usually orange) and a helper will come to you as soon as
    they can. We often have several helpers, so that you can get help
    quickly. Putting up a little hat is a low effort way of asking for
    help. You don't need to raise your hand that everyone can see nor
    interrupt the teacher, and you can keep trying to follow along (or
    fix the issue) as you wait for a helper to come over. This means it
    will be easier for you to ask for help, which is what we want in a
    learning setting! :grin:

Now you know a bit more about the thoughts behind how we've designed
this workshop to really try to support and enable your learning! :tada:
