We try to be consistent with the way to present certain information in
this website. Specifically, there are a few "syntax" type formatting of
the text to know about:

-   Folder names always end with `/`, for example `data/` means the data
    folder.
-   File names always end with their file extension, for example
    `content.md` means the file is a Markdown file.
