We will explain this a bit during the lessons, but read this to start
learning how the website is structured and how to read certain things.
Specifically, there are a few "syntax" type formatting of the text in
this website to be aware of:

-   Folder names always end with a `/`, for example `data/` means the
    data folder.
-   File names always end with their file extension, for example `content.md`
    means the file is a Markdown file.
