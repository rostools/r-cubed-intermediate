We will explain this a bit more during the workshop, but read this
section to know how to read certain things on the website. Specifically,
there are a few "syntax" type formatting of text on the website to know
about:

-   Folder names always end with a `/`, for example `data/` means the
    data folder.
-   File names always end with their file extension, for example
    `content.md` means the file is a Markdown file.
-   R variables are always shown as is. For instance, for the code
    `x <- 10`, `x` is a variable because it was assigned with 10.
-   Functions always end with `()`, for instance `mean()` or
    `read_csv()`.
-   Sometimes functions have their package name appended with `::` so
    that you run the code from the specific package, since we likely
    haven't loaded the package with `library()`. For instance, to
    install packages from GitHub using the `{pak}` package we use
    `pak::pak("user/package_name")`. You'll learn about this more later.
