The first thing to do is to install these programs. You may already have
some of them installed and if you do, please make sure that they are at
least the minimum versions listed below. If not, you will need to update
them.

::: panel-tabset
### Windows

1.  [R](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/): Any version
    above `r min(r3admin::get_allowed_r_versions())`. If you have used R
    before, you can confirm the version by running `R.version.string` in
    the Console.
2.  [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download):
    Any version above `r r3admin::get_allowed_rstudio_versions()[1]`. If
    you have installed it before, check the current version by going to
    the menu `Help -> About RStudio`.
3.  [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win): Select the "Click here to
    download" link. Git is used throughout many sessions in the courses.
    When installing, it will ask for a selecting a "Text Editor" and
    while we won't be using this in the course, Git needs to know this
    information so choose Notepad.
4.  [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/): Version
    that says "R-release". Rtools is needed in order to build some R
    packages. For some computers, installing Rtools can take some time.

### MacOS

1.  [R](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/macosx/): Any version above
    `r min(r3admin::get_allowed_r_versions())`. If you have used R
    before, you can confirm the version by running `R.version.string` in
    the Console. If you use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), installing R
    is as easy as opening a Terminal and running:

    ``` bash
    brew install --cask r
    ```

2.  [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download):
    Any version above `r r3admin::get_allowed_rstudio_versions()[1]`. If
    you have installed it before, check the current version by going to
    the menu `Help -> About RStudio`. With Homebrew:

    ``` bash
    brew install --cask rstudio
    ```

3.  [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/mac): Git is used throughout many
    sessions in the courses. With Homebrew:

    ``` bash
    brew install git
    ```

### Linux (Ubuntu)

1.  [R](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/): Any version
    above `r min(r3admin::get_allowed_r_versions())`. If you have used R
    before, you can confirm the version by running `R.version.string` in
    the Console.

    ``` bash
    sudo apt -y install r-base
    ```

2.  [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download):
    Any version above `r r3admin::get_allowed_rstudio_versions()[1]`. If
    you have installed it before, check the current version by going to
    the menu `Help -> About RStudio`.

3.  [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/mac): Git is used throughout many
    sessions in the courses.

    ``` bash
    sudo apt install git
    ```

All these programs are required for the course, even Git. Git, which is
a software program to formally manage versions of files, is used because
of it's popularity and the amount of documentation available for it.
Check out the online book [Happy Git with
R](https://happygitwithr.com/), especially the "Why Git" section, for an
understanding on why we are teaching Git. Windows users tend to have
more trouble with installing Git than macOS or Linux users. See the
section on [Installing Git for
Windows](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html#install-git-windows)
for help.

Some pictures may show a Git pane in RStudio, but you may not see it. If
you haven't created or opened an RStudio R Project (which is taught in
the introductory course), the Git pane *does not* show up. It only shows
up in R Projects that use Git to track file changes.

::: {.callout-note appearance="default"}
*A note to those who have or use work laptops with restrictive
administrative privileges*: You may encounter problems installing
software due to administrative reasons (e.g. you don't have permission
to install things). Even if you have issues installing or updating the
latest version of R or RStudio, you will likely be able to continue with
the course as long as you have the minimum version listed above for R
and for RStudio. If you have versions of R and RStudio that are older
than that, you may need to ask your IT department to update your
software if you can't do this yourself. Unfortunately, Git is not a
commonly used software for some organizations, so you may not have it
installed and you *will* need to ask IT to install it. We *require* it
for the course, so please make sure to give IT enough time to be able to
install it for you prior to the course.
:::

Once R, RStudio, and Git have been installed, open RStudio. *If you
encounter any troubles during these pre-course tasks*, try as best as
you can to complete the task and then let us know about the issues in
the pre-course survey of the course. If you continue having problems,
indicate on the survey that you need help and we can try to book a quick
video call to fix the problem. Otherwise, you can come to the course
15-20 minutes earlier to get help.

If you're unable to complete the setup procedure due to unfixable
technical issues, you can use Posit Cloud (to use RStudio on the cloud)
as a final solution in order to participate in the course. For help
setting up Posit Cloud for this course, refer to the [Posit Cloud setup
guide](https://guides.rostools.org/posit-cloud).
