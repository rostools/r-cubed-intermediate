## Code used in this session

This lists *some*, but not all, of the code used in the section. Some
code is incorporated into Markdown content, so is harder to
automatically list here in a code chunk. The code below also includes
the code from the exercises.

<!-- The stringr subset removes code chunks that aren't shown or typed by the learner. -->

```{r code-appendix}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| ref-label: !expr stringr::str_subset(knitr::all_labels(), "^(unnamed-chunk-.*|purl-only-.*|setup|admin-.*|fig-.*)", negate = TRUE)
```
