Day 2 afternoon (13:15, end at 16:45 --- ~3.5 hrs, with one big break, one small one during exercise):

- functional programming
    - Expand on explanation
    - purrr
    - Why purrr vs *apply functions?
        - Consistency, expectation, documentation, design.
    - Show importing one vs many
        - Use fs to list multiple files
        - Talk about filesystem
    - Possible uses:
        - Show basic usage with paste and numbers, etc.
        - calculating mean from df
            - select only numeric (select where is.numeric)
            - show off the ... here (like with na.rm)
        - Any time you think you would use a for loop, use this.
        - Import data, with some wrangling, for https://physionet.org/content/mmash/1.0.0/
            - Using what we learned to wrangle all data files into one single one
        - Run multiple models and extract only some information
        - Run models on re-sampled sets
        - Combining with parallel processing?
            - Don't get them to do this, just show it.
    - Real examples: 
        - my webscraping of the DST etc
        - Running multiple models
    - Show but don't get them to do: other versions of functions in purrr
    
    - Include some final dplyr summarizing of results of mmash
        - load_all workflow
        - but use source at end
    
- slides afterward
    - Incorporate open and reproducible practices in coding

Post course?

## Code:

vroom takes file as a vector, so naively you could give it all the filenames
and let it read them in.. but then you don't know where the data came from.
Two solutions:

- imap_dfr with fs filenames with .id = "ID"
- vroom with id = "ID"

Show both to give example of how vroom works under the hood with imap 

```{r}

```


## Misc


You notice above that we copied and pasted multiple `plot_scatter_by_group()` calls
to create three plots. Sometimes this is ok, but often when you start doing mostly
the same thing, it's better to try to reduce your repetition (i.e. don't repeat
yourself, DRY). Here we will get into iterations and using "[functional] programming"
via the `map` function from the [purrr] package. Functional programming is a way 
of making use of vectors and [vectorisation] to "loop" over things (rather than
use `for` loops). There are several reasons why you should avoid `for` loops in
R.

1. They are computationally very slow and easily use a lot of RAM memory.
1. They are difficult to read and debug.
1. They aren't very *expressive*, meaning they don't state a higher "purpose",
just that they loop over something.

[purrr]: https://purrr.tidyverse.org/
[vectorisation]: https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/vectorized-operations.html
[functional]: https://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functionals.html

But functionals, like `map` and most functions inside purrr (or base R functions
like `lapply`, `sapply`) let you ignore the tiny details and focus on doing your
intent. You *intend* to `sum` a vector of numbers, not loop over each number and
add to the total (as you would in a `for` loop).

For the example, let's say we want to calculate the mean and SD for several
categorical variables. We can use `map` to easily do this, by giving it a vector
of variables and providing the function to apply to each:

```{r map-on-wrangling}
map(c("SurveyYr", "Diabetes", "Gender"),
    # the ~ tells map the next code is all together as one argument
    # .x says to insert the value from the first argument of map (Diabetes, etc)
    ~mean_sd_by_group(NHANES, .x))
```

It seems deceptively simple but there is a massive amount of power from doing this
sort of coding. Let's try with the plots.

```{r map-on-plots}
map(c("Diabetes", "Education", "HomeOwn"),
    ~plot_scatter_by_group(NHANES, "Height", "Weight", .x))
```

What if we want to provide two things at once? We can use `map2` for that! (Note,
the two arguments should be the same length.)

```{r map2-on-plots}
map2(c("TotChol", "Pulse"),
    c("Diabetes", "Education"),
    # .y is for the second argument of map
    ~plot_scatter_by_group(NHANES, "Height", .x, .y))
```

If you want to do all combinations of two vectors, use the purrr function `cross_df()`
to create a data.frame of the combinations. Note that, like most purrr functions,
it takes a list as input.

```{r all-combinations}
all_combinations <- cross_df(list(
    xvar = c("TotChol", "Pulse"),
    groupvar = c("Diabetes", "Education")
    ))
all_combinations
```

```{r plot-all-combinations, eval=FALSE}
map2(all_combinations$xvar, all_combinations$groupvar,
    ~plot_scatter_by_group(NHANES, "BMI", .x, .y))
```

Using map is really useful when importing raw data that is in a standard form
and structure. Combined with the [fs] package (fs for filesystem), this is very
powerful. To show how to do it, let's first export NHANES into the `data/` folder.

[fs]: https://fs.r-lib.org/

```{r export-nhanes, eval=FALSE}
NHANES %>% 
    filter(SurveyYr == "2009_10") %>% 
    write_csv(here::here("data/nhanes-2009_10.csv"))

NHANES %>% 
    filter(SurveyYr == "2011_12") %>% 
    write_csv(here::here("data/nhanes-2011_12.csv"))
```

Then we can use the `dir_ls()` (for directory list) from fs combined with the 
`regexp` (for regular expression) argument to show all files that have
nhanes in the name, have anything in the middle (`.*`), and end with (`$`) csv.

```{r rename-data, echo=FALSE}
fs::file_move(here::here("_data/"), here::here("data/"))
```


```{r fs-list-data-files}
data_files <- fs::dir_ls(here::here("data/"), regexp = "nhanes-.*csv$")
data_files
```

Then we can import all at once using `map_dfr` (for map and convert to a `df`
data.frame, stacking by `r` row):

```{r import-data}
data_files %>% 
    map_dfr(read_csv)
```

```{r rename-data-back, echo=FALSE}
fs::file_move(here::here("data/"), here::here("_data/"))
```

Nifty eh?

### Easier to use parallel processing with map

One big reason to get comfortable and good at using map is because you can use
parallel processing to speed up your analysis with the `future_` series of
functions from the [furrr] package.

[furrr]: https://davisvaughan.github.io/furrr/index.html

```{r parallel-processing, eval=FALSE}
library(furrr)
# Use a combination of more of your CPU or creating multiple R sessions
plan(multiprocess)

# Use parallel processing
future_map2(all_combinations$xvar, all_combinations$groupvar,
    ~plot_scatter_by_group(NHANES, "BMI", .x, .y))
```

## idea Final exercise

Time: Until end of session.

Create a new file for this exercise:

```{r final-exercise-file, eval=FALSE}
usethis::use_r("efficiency-exercise")
```

Copy and paste the template code (further below) into the
`R/efficiency-exercise.R` file. Simplify the below code into three functions.
Then iterate with one `map` to read in and wrangle each dataset, followed by two
`map` calls to create the two different plots for each dataset.

```{r final-exercise, eval=FALSE}
nhanes_2009 <- read_csv(here::here("data/nhanes-2009_10.csv"))

nhanes_2009 %>% 
    mutate(ProblemBMIs = !between(BMI, 18.5, 40)) %>% 
    filter(!is.na(ProblemBMIs)) %>% 
    select(Age, Poverty, Pulse, BPSysAve, BPDiaAve, TotChol,
           SleepHrsNight, PhysActiveDays, ProblemBMIs) %>% 
    gather(Measurement, Value, -ProblemBMIs) %>% 
    na.omit() %>% 
    ggplot(aes(y = Value, x = Measurement, colour = ProblemBMIs)) +
    geom_jitter(position = position_dodge(width = 0.6)) +
    scale_color_viridis_d(end = 0.8) +
    labs(y = "", x = "") +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(legend.position = c(0.85, 0.85)) +
    coord_flip()

nhanes_2009 %>% 
    mutate(ProblemBMIs = !between(BMI, 18.5, 40)) %>% 
    filter(!is.na(ProblemBMIs)) %>% 
    select(Age, Poverty, Pulse, BPSysAve, BPDiaAve, TotChol,
           SleepHrsNight, PhysActiveDays, ProblemBMIs) %>% 
    gather(Measurement, Value, -ProblemBMIs) %>% 
    na.omit() %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = Value, fill = ProblemBMIs)) +
    geom_density(alpha = 0.35) +
    facet_wrap(~Measurement, scales = "free") +
    scale_fill_viridis_d(end = 0.8) +
    labs(y = "", x = "") +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(legend.position = c(0.85, 0.15),
          strip.text = element_text(face = "bold")) 

nhanes_2011 <- read_csv(here::here("data/nhanes-2011_12.csv"))
    
nhanes_2011 %>% 
    mutate(ProblemBMIs = !between(BMI, 18.5, 40)) %>% 
    filter(!is.na(ProblemBMIs)) %>% 
    select(Age, Poverty, Pulse, BPSysAve, BPDiaAve, TotChol,
           SleepHrsNight, PhysActiveDays, ProblemBMIs) %>% 
    gather(Measurement, Value, -ProblemBMIs) %>% 
    na.omit() %>% 
    ggplot(aes(y = Value, x = Measurement, colour = ProblemBMIs)) +
    geom_jitter(position = position_dodge(width = 0.6)) +
    scale_color_viridis_d(end = 0.8) +
    labs(y = "", x = "") +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(legend.position = c(0.85, 0.85)) +
    coord_flip()

nhanes_2011 %>% 
    mutate(ProblemBMIs = !between(BMI, 18.5, 40)) %>% 
    filter(!is.na(ProblemBMIs)) %>% 
    select(Age, Poverty, Pulse, BPSysAve, BPDiaAve, TotChol,
           SleepHrsNight, PhysActiveDays, ProblemBMIs) %>% 
    gather(Measurement, Value, -ProblemBMIs) %>% 
    na.omit() %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = Value, fill = ProblemBMIs)) +
    geom_density(alpha = 0.35) +
    facet_wrap(~Measurement, scales = "free") +
    scale_fill_viridis_d(end = 0.8) +
    labs(y = "", x = "") +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(legend.position = c(0.85, 0.15),
          strip.text = element_text(face = "bold")) 
```

Use this as a template for completing the exercise:

```{r final-exercise-template, eval=FALSE}
read_mutate_gather <- function(.file_path) {
    .file_path %>% 
        ___
}

plot_jitter <- function(.dataset) {
    .dataset %>% 
        ___
}

plot_density <- function(.dataset) {
    .dataset %>% 
        ___
}

# Read in and wrangle each csv file 
data_list <- 
    c(here::here("data/nhanes-2009_10.csv"),
      here::here("data/nhanes-2011_12.csv")) %>% 
    # (keep as list, i.e. don't use map_dfr)
    ___(___) 

# Plot each data with jitters
___(data_list, ___)

# Plot each data with density
___(data_list, ___)
```

If you've finished the exercise early, try using the furrr package to implement
parallel processing on these `map` calls.

```{r final-exercise-solution, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
read_mutate_gather <- function(.file_path) {
    .file_path %>% 
        read_csv() %>% 
        mutate(ProblemBMIs = !between(BMI, 18.5, 40)) %>% 
        filter(!is.na(ProblemBMIs)) %>% 
        select(Age, Poverty, Pulse, BPSysAve, BPDiaAve, TotChol,
               SleepHrsNight, PhysActiveDays, ProblemBMIs) %>% 
        gather(Measurement, Value, -ProblemBMIs) %>% 
        na.omit() 
}

plot_jitter <- function(.dataset) {
    .dataset %>% 
        ggplot(aes(y = Value, x = Measurement, colour = ProblemBMIs)) +
        geom_jitter(position = position_dodge(width = 0.6)) +
        scale_color_viridis_d(end = 0.8) +
        labs(y = "", x = "") +
        theme_minimal() +
        theme(legend.position = c(0.85, 0.85)) +
        coord_flip()
}

plot_density <- function(.dataset) {
    .dataset %>% 
        ggplot(aes(x = Value, fill = ProblemBMIs)) +
        geom_density(alpha = 0.35) +
        facet_wrap(~Measurement, scales = "free") +
        scale_fill_viridis_d(end = 0.8) +
        labs(y = "", x = "") +
        theme_minimal() +
        theme(legend.position = c(0.85, 0.15),
              strip.text = element_text(face = "bold")) 
}

data_list <- 
    c(here::here("data/nhanes-2009_10.csv"),
      here::here("data/nhanes-2011_12.csv")) %>% 
    map(read_mutate_gather) 

# Plot the jitters
map(data_list, plot_jitter)

# Plot the density
map(data_list, plot_density)
```
