1. Learn how to import and do minor cleaning with the vroom package
1. Learn about strategies and resources to use when encountering problems when
importing data
    
## The MMASH dataset

- download datasets to use as practice?
    - https://physionet.org/content/mmash/1.0.0/
        - https://physionet.org/static/published-projects/mmash/multilevel-monitoring-of-activity-and-sleep-in-healthy-people-1.0.0.zip
        - DOI https://doi.org/10.13026/cerq-fc86
        
Talk about it's license (open license).
        
Go to website and talk about it for a bit.


```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(here)
# In console
usethis::use_data_raw("mmash", open = FALSE)
# Open up and use the mmash R script.
```

Open up and use mmash.R

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# TODO: Use r3 for link? r3::mmash_zip_link
mmash_link <- "https://physionet.org/static/published-projects/mmash/multilevel-monitoring-of-activity-and-sleep-in-healthy-people-1.0.0.zip"
download.file(mmash_link, destfile = here("data-raw/mmash-data.zip"))
```

In console, because we don't need to keep original dataset,
since it is located in the link given.

```{r}
# Only need to do this once.
usethis::use_git_ignore("data-raw/mmash-data.zip")
```

Git commit this git ignore, then git commit the mmash.R.

Have a quick look inside the zip file (they don't need to do this).

- fs
    - introduce this package to get ready for later use?

Reference here::here. Show project tree and talk through from there how it works

Here because we start with the original raw dataset for mmash-data.zip,
we should record exactly how we process the data set for use.

- Keeping raw data raw.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(here)
# TODO: This could be executed on gitlab-ci?
# Have this in the mmash.R script
unzip(here("data-raw/mmash-data.zip"), 
      exdir = here("data-raw"),
      # This unzipped into the data-raw folder
      junkpaths = TRUE)
unzip(here("data-raw/MMASH.zip"),
      exdir = here("data-raw"))
fs::dir_tree() # copy this output and show as what it looks like
fs::file_delete(here(c("data-raw/MMASH.zip", 
                       "data-raw/SHA256SUMS.txt",
                       "data-raw/LICENSE.txt")))
fs::file_move(here("data-raw/DataPaper"), here("data-raw/mmash"))
fs::dir_tree() # copy this output and show as what it looks like after
```

IN console:

```{r}
usethis::use_git_ignore("data-raw/mmash/")
fs::file_create(here("data-raw/README.md"))
# Open up and write very briefly about license and mmash and location of data
# Commit
```

Git commit ignore and README file.

## Move to lesson.Rmd

Create header `## Importing raw dataset`

We'll make a new code chunk with "Ctrl-Alt-I" and call it `setup`.
Inside the code chunk we'll load the [vroom] package with `library(vroom)`.
It should look like this:

TODO: confirm this is right link

[vroom]: https://vroom.tidyverse.org 

````markdown
`r ''````{r setup}
library(vroom)
`r ''````
````

This specially-named code chunk tells R to run this code chunk first whenever
you first start running code in this R Markdown file. So it's here that we will
add `library()` when we want to load other packages.

**Take 5 minutes to read the next {{NUM}} paragraphs**.

What is [vroom]? It is a package designed to load in data, specifically text-based
data files such as CSV. In R there are several packages that you can use to
load in data and different types of data. We'll quickly cover those other
packages: 

- [haven]: For reading in SAS, SPSS, and Stata files.
- [readxl]: Others?
- [googlesheets4]: ?
- [fst]: ...
- [readr]: Standard package used to load in text-based data files like CSV. 
This package is included by default with tidyverse.
- [`utils::read.delim()`][read-delim]: This function comes from the core R
package utils and includes other functions like `utils::read.csv()`.
- [`data.table::fread()`][fread]: From the [data.table]

TODO: Confirm this is correct link
[data.table]: https://rdatatable.org
[haven]: 
[readxl]: 
[googlesheets4]: 
[fst]: 
[readr]: 
[read-delim]: 
[fread]: 

We're using the vroom package for largely one reason: It makes use of recent
improvements in R that allow data to be imported in very very quickly. 
Just how fast? The vroom website has a [benchmark page](TODO) showing how fast it
is. And for many people, loading in the data can be one of the most time-consuming
parts of starting an analysis. Hopefully by using this package, that time can be
reduced. And since it also builds off and mimics the existing readr package, so
any documentation and help for readr can easily be applied to vroom, since they
are used the same. Because readr has been around for awhile and is part of the
tidyverse, there is a large amount of support and help for using it.
If you're curious to learn more about vroom, check out the [website](TODO).

If your data is in CSV format, vroom is perfect. If not, there are other ways of
importing data which we won't cover. The CSV file format is a commonly used 
format for data because it is open, readable by any computer, and doesn't
depend on any special software to open (unlike for e.g. Excel spreadsheets).

We're switching to use `here::here()` instead of `library(here)` like we did
in the `data-raw/mmash.R` script because in the `doc/lesson.Rmd` file
we will mostly be doing things interactively while the script is meant to be run
once from top to bottom. Plus, we're only using it a few times, so we don't 
need to load all of the here package.

```{r first-load-in-user-info}
library(vroom)
user_1_info_file <- here::here("data-raw/mmash/user_1/user_info.csv")
user_1_info_data <- vroom(user_1_info_file)
```

You'll see the output mention using `spec()` to use in the argument `col_types`.
And that it has 5 columns, one called `...1`. If we look at the CSV file though,
we see that there are only four columns with names... but that technically 
there is a first empty column without a column header.
So, let's figure out what this message means. 
Let's go to the **Console** and type out:

```r
?vroom::spec
```

In the documentation, we see that it says:

> "extracts the full column specification from a tibble..."

Without seeing the output, it's not clear what "specification" means. So let's 
use `spec()` on the dataset variable. In the **Console** again:

```{r}
spec(user_1_info_data)
```

Ok, so from this we can see that a specification is what columns are imported
into R and what data type they are given. Next, let's see what the message
meant about `col_types`. Let's check out the help documentation for `vroom()`
by typing in the **Console**:

```r
?vroom::vroom
```

And if we scroll down to the explanation of `col_types`:

> "One of NULL, a cols() specification, or a string. See vignette("readr") for
more details."

It says to use a "cols() specification", which is likely the output of `spec()`.
So, let's copy and paste the output from `spec()` and paste it into the 
`col_types` argument of `vroom()`.

TODO: see if we can use anything from the vroom website

```{r, eval=FALSE, error=TRUE}
user_1_info_data <- vroom(
    user_1_info_file,
    col_types = cols(
        ...1 = col_double(),
        Gender = col_character(),
        Weight = col_double(),
        Height = col_double(),
        Age = col_double(),
        .delim = ","
    )
)
```

Hmm. An error. Ok, if we look through the message, there's the part that says: 

> "The following named parsers don't match the column names: ...1"

We copy and pasted, so what's going on? If you recall, the `user_info.csv`
file has an empty column name. Looking at the [data dictionary][mmash-site]
it doesn't seem there is any reference to this column, so it seems it isn't 
important. Since we don't need it, let's just get rid of it when we load in 
the dataset. But how? Let's look at the help documentation again. Go to the 
**Console** and type out:

[mmash-site]:

```r
?vroom::vroom
```

Looking at the list of arguments, there is an argument called `col_select`
that sounds like we could use that to keep or drop columns. It says that it
is used similar to `dplyr::select()`, which normally is used with actual column 
names. Our column doesn't have a name, that's the problem. Next let's check the
Example section of the help. Scrolling down, you'll eventually see:

> `vroom(input_file, col_select = c(1, 3, 11))`

So, it takes numbers! With `dplyr::select()`, using the `-` before the column
name (or number) means to drop the column, so in this case, we could drop the
first column with `col_select = -1`!

```{r second-load-in-info-no-error}
user_1_info_data <- vroom(
    user_1_info_file,
    col_select = -1,
    col_types = cols(
        Gender = col_character(),
        Weight = col_double(),
        Height = col_double(),
        Age = col_double()
    )
)
```

Amazing! We did it `r emo::ji("grin")`

We can now look at the data:

```{r print-user-info-data}
user_1_info_data
```

Why might we use `spec()` and `col_types`? Depending on the size of the dataset,
it may take a long time to load everything, which may not be very efficient
if you only intend to use some parts of the dataset and not all of it.
And sometimes, `spec()` incorrectly guesses the column types, so using
`col_types = cols()` can fix those problems.

If you have a lot of columns in your dataset, then you can make use of
`col_select` or `cols_only()` to keep only the columns you want.
Check out the [website](TODO) or the [help documentation](TODO) for more details
on how to use those.

## Exercise: Import the saliva data

Time: 15 min

Practice importing data files by doing the same process with the saliva data.

1. Create a new header at the bottom of the `doc/lesson.Rmd` file
and call it `## Exercise: Import the saliva data`.
1. Below the header, create a new code chunk with "Ctrl-Alt-I".
1. Copy and paste the code template below into the new code chunk.
Begin replacing the `___` with the correct R functions or other information.
1. Look at the [data dictionary][mmash-site] and find out what the column
`ibi_s` means and rename the column to be something more meaningful and
readable. Use the `rename()` function from the dplyr package to rename the
column and use [`snake_case`][snake-case] when naming the new column.
Read the `?dplyr::rename` help to know how to rename columns.

[snake-case]: TODO

```{r solution-try-vroom, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
user_1_saliva_file <- here::here("data-raw/mmash/user_1/saliva.csv")
user_1_saliva_data_prep <- vroom(user_1_saliva_file,
                                 col_select = -1)
spec(user_1_saliva_data_prep)

user_1_saliva_data <- vroom(
    user_1_saliva_file,
    col_select = -1,
    col_type = cols(
        ibi_s = col_double(),
        day = col_double(),
        time = col_time(format = "")
    )
) %>% 
    # Rename the ibi_s column
    rename(index... = ibi_s)
```

## Importing with larger datasets

Sometimes you have a dataset that's just a bit too large and sometimes
vroom may not have enough information to guess the column data type
or you don't want to read in all the dataset, but only specific columns
In that case, we can do a trick: read in only first few lines of the dataset,
use spec, fix the col_type

- then fix column names based on data dictionary

We can see from the data file size that it is fairly big.
So, we'll use this technique to decide what we want to keep etc.
(use my UK Biobank analysis as example)

```{r}
user_1_rr_file <- here("data-raw/mmash/user_1/RR.csv")
user_1_rr_data_prep <- vroom(user_1_rr_file,
                             n_max = 1000,
                             col_select = -1)
spec(user_1_rr_data_prep)
```

Like with last time, copy and paste the output into a new use of `vroom()`.
Remove the `.delim` line and the `...1` line. 
Don't forget to also remove the last `,` at the end!

```{r}
user_1_rr_data <- vroom(
    user_1_rr_file,
    col_select = -1,
    col_types = cols(
        ibi_s = col_double(),
        day = col_double(),
        # Converts to seconds
        time = col_time(format = "")
    )
)
```

## Exercise: 

Time: 15 min

Do the same this with `Actigraph.csv` dataset, which is larger than the `RR.csv`
data. But first:

1. Create a new header at the bottom of the `doc/lesson.Rmd` file
and call it `## Exercise: Larger datasets`.
1. Below the header, create a new code chunk with "Ctrl-Alt-I".

Use the same technique as was used for the `RR.csv` data 
and read in the `Actigraph.csv` file from `user_1/`.

1. Set the file path to the dataset with `here::here()`. and select specific cols
and set col_types
- keep only 
- Look through data dictionary and rename columns to be more descriptive

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# Search help documentation to show how to find this stuff.

# Use first 100 or so lines to get spec
user_1_rr_file <- here("data-raw/mmash/user_1/RR.csv")
user_1_rr_data_prep <- vroom(user_1_rr_file,
                             n_max = 1000,
                             col_select = -1)
spec(user_1_rr_data_prep)

user_1_rr_data <- vroom(
    user_1_rr_file,
    col_select = -1,
    col_types = cols(
        ibi_s = col_double(),
        day = col_double(),
        # Converts to seconds
        time = col_time(format = "")
    )
)
```

## Combining datasets

```{r}
library(dplyr)
user_1_fix %>% bind_cols(user_1_rr_fix)
```


`r '-->'`
